# 🎓 AI Chatbot for Student Support Services

An end-to-end, beginner-friendly **Generative AI course project** — a web-based chatbot
that helps students get instant answers about admissions, scholarships, courses, fees,
hostel, placements, library, exams, and more. Built with **Flask** and powered by the
**Google Gemini API**.

- Requires no database — it's a lightweight, stateless Flask app

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone / Download the project
Unzip the project folder and open it in **VS Code**.

### 2. Create a virtual environment (recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv

# Activate it:
# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Get your Google Gemini API Key

1. Go to **[Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)**
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click **"Create API Key"**
4. Copy the generated key

### 5. Add your API key to `.env`

Open the `.env` file in the project root and replace the placeholder:

```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
```

⚠️ **Never share your `.env` file or commit it to a public GitHub repo.**

### 6. Run the application

```bash
python app.py
```

The app will start at:

```

## 👩‍💻 Author's Note

This project was built as a **Generative AI course project** to demonstrate how to
integrate a Large Language Model (Google Gemini) into a full-stack web application
using Flask, with a clean and modular codebase suitable for learning purposes.

Enjoy building! 🎉
